# GeoCorpora
The GeoCorpora project aims at creating corpora of fully geo-annotated texts (in particular microblog texts) and developing tools to support the corpus building process using crowd-sourcing and visual analytics approaches. Created corpora will be made publicly available in this repository. A first corpus of ~6000 geo-annotated tweets will be published here in the near future.
